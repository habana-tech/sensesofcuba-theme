	<div class="row">
		<h2>TOURCOM GmbH </h2>
		<p>
			TOURCOM GmbH also working under the brand names SENSES of CUBA and PORTRAITS of CUBA acts as intermediary between transportation companies, hotels and any other providers or individuals and the clients.
			The present General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) shall determine - subject to additional supplement agreements - the contractual relationship between TOURCOM GmbH and the client. Any deviating terms of business of client are hereby expressly excluded.
			Offers from TOURCOM GmbH are mainly addressed to entrepreneurs (=B2B), such as tour operators, travel agencies, independent travel planners and travel designers, incentive- & MICE agencies, corporate companies, cruise ship companies among others. In case that the contract partner is the traveller himself (=B2C), e.g. direct client, the term “client”, mentioned in the GTCs below also apply to the traveller.
		</p>

		<h2>Documentation</h2>
		<p>
			Each traveller is responsible for carrying a valid passport and possessing any required visa(s) for his journey. The organizer (TOURCOM GmbH) is exempt from any liability should a traveller be deported or refused entry for not meeting entry requirements or passport irregularities. The traveller will be responsible for any of the costs as a result of this, according to our established cancellation policies and voluntary withdrawal from our services. It is incumbent on the client alone to notify his travellers in due time on pertinent passport, visa and healthcare regulations, as well as any amendments thereof.
		</p>

		<h2>Self-drive</h2>
		<p>
			At the time of rental, the driver must present a valid national driver‘s license that has been held for at least 1 year and he must be at least 21 years old. An International Driving Permit (IDP) is highly recommended for non-European Union renters. Further a photo ID (passport etc.) along with a valid credit card are required.
		</p>

		<h2>Vouchers</h2>
		<p>
			After receiving payment in full on reservations made by the client (e.g. for hotels, excursions, roundtrips etc.) the vouchers for the booked services will be handed over at the airport or deposed at the hotel or sent before by e-mail. Travellers are required to present these vouchers at hotels or to our tour guides.
		</p>

		<h2>Hotels</h2>
		<p>
			All hotels on our tours have been carefully selected according to availability. Internet in the hotels has to be paid separately, if not included in the room rate. Most of the hotels offer non-smoking single, double or twin rooms. Triple rooms are not standard. However, upon request an additional (smaller) /separate bed may be provided. Check-in time is usually at 2 pm and Check-out at noon. All hotels selected for the programs are subject to change. If a change becomes necessary for any reason, travelers will be accommodated in hotels that are equivalent in service and price category as those listed.
		</p>

		<h2>Transportation</h2>
		<p>
			Transportation on our tours is conducted by car, minivan, microbus, minibus or tourbus, depending on the number of passengers. If the number of participants confirmed on a tour is small, TOURCOM GmbH reserves the right to conduct transportation in a passenger vehicle or minivan driven by the guide, in order to comply with our guaranteed departure dates.
		</p>

		<h2>Luggage</h2>
		<p>
			For their tours within Cuba, each traveller is entitled to bring one medium-sized piece of luggage, with a maximum weight of 30 kg and one piece of hand luggage (up to 12 kg), free of charge. Transportation of excess luggage is subject to space availability and clients must inform about excess luggage (e.g. in case of a business class flight) in advance. If the excess luggage exceeds the capacity of the vehicle and TOURCOM GmbH has not been informed before, the traveller has to pay for extra transportation (e.g. taxi or bigger vehicle). Luggage will be transported at the owner’s risk. TOURCOM GmbH is not responsible for loss, theft or damage to the luggage during the trip. We recommend that travellers remain present at all times when their luggage is being handled. In case of air, river or sea transportation of luggage, the specific conditions of the transportation companies apply as set out in the passenger‘s ticket. In case of loss or damages, we recommend filing an immediate complaint to the company (e.g. airline) responsible for transportation. TOURCOM GmbH will assist in case of lost luggage but cannot pick-up lost luggage in the name of the traveller at the airport. Travellers should wait until the airline has delivered the lost luggage to their hotel or accomodation or they must pick-up the luggage themselves at the airport. Any costs involved (e.g. taxi to and from the airport) have to be paid by the travellers. We would like to remind travellers that they are responsible for their belongings.
		</p>

		<h2>Tour guide</h2>
		<p>
			Travellers will be accompanied by a tour guide or a driver guide or a driver (depending on the booking) during the entire travel program, except if they have only booked accommodation or a domestic flight or a rental car. We will provide a tour guide / driver guide who speaks the language which has been requested by or agreed with the client and finally been confirmed by TOURCOM GmbH during the booking process. All our guides / driver guides have experience and are specially trained for each travel program. If the clients have booked a self-drive tour with a rental car, travellers will not be accompanied by a guide / driver guide or driver.
		</p>

		<h2>Special conditions for children</h2>
		<p>
			In general (to be confirmed prior to booking) children younger than 1 year will have a reduction of 90% or more of the total fare and children between the ages of 2 and 11.99 years will receive a 25% discount, if sharing accommodations with their parents or 2 adults. There is only one child permitted in a double or twin room. Any exception must be mutually agreed during the booking process.
		</p>

		<h2>Payment</h2>
		<p>
			All reserved services require payment in full prior to arrival date, according to the following conditions:
		</p>
		<p>
			100% payment 30 days prior to arrival
		</p>
		<p>
			In case of groups, incentive groups, special interest tours, conferences, cruise ships a 10 – 50% payment upon confirmation can apply (in case of air tickets up to 100%) or there can be other payment conditions depending on the provider. TOURCOM GmbH will inform in advance if there are special payment conditions.

		</p>
		<p>
			Payments should be made via bank transfer on our bank account in Germany or via credit card (MASTERCARD or VISA). Fees for bank transfers must be paid by the client.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the event advance payments or the total respectively remaining amount is not paid by the client within the period agreed upon, TOURCOM GmbH may refuse performance and, after a reasonable grace period granted, withdraw from the contract once the service was not yet performed. In such event, TOURCOM GmbH shall invoice client cancellation costs in accordance with our cancellation policy (see the term “Cancellations” below).
		</p>

		<h2>Changes in prices </h2>
		<p>
			There are certain cases in which prices already fixed in our TOURCOM GmbH programs may have an increase for special reasons such as for example:
		</p>
		<ul  class="col-md-12 pl-4" style="list-style: circle;">
			<li>Price increase by transport companies (related, for instance, to the increase in the price of fuel)</li>
			<li>Increase of Government Taxes (for example value added tax or custom duties or increase of airport tax)</li>
			<li>Fluctuation of currency exchange rates (5% and more)</li>
			<li>Considerable increase on prices by the service providers (for instance unexpected changes of hotel contracts during a season)</li>
			<li>Obvious mistakes in our programs</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In case that TOURCOM GmbH should increase prices due to any of the above-mentioned reasons (increase of 5% or more), clients will be notified at the latest within 21 days prior to the date of the arrival date. If the price increase is higher than 10% of the initially agreed price, the client has the right to cancel the contract without cost at all (within 5 days of receiving said notice). In such case, all payments already made would be refunded within a period of maximum 30 days.  In this case clients do have the possibility to book one of our alternative programs or itineraries. TOURCOM GmbH is very committed to realize the wishes of clients according to our possibilities and will refund all payments already executed.
		</p>

		<h2>Amendment of Services</h2>
		<p>
			TOURCOM GmbH is entitled to amend contracted services in case of serious reasons, which occur after contracting, and make such amendment inevitable. No amendments or deviations shall be admissible which substantially affect the overall character of the performance respectively the package services - or are unacceptable for the client in consideration of mutual interests, or discriminatory under the principle of good faith. Warranty claims shall remain unaffected as far as such amended services are flawed with defects. TOURCOM GmbH shall inform the client immediately about alterations contemplated in sentence 1 of this term.
		</p>

		<h2>Cancellations</h2>
		<p>
			Cancellations should be made in written form.
			The general cancellation costs are as follows:
		</p>

		<p>
			Upon confirmation to 46 days of arrival: min. 50 EUR per person (max. 150 EUR for the whole booking)
		</p>
		<ul  class="col-md-12 pl-4" style="list-style: circle;">
			<li>Cancellation 45 to 30 days before arrival: 30%</li>

Airlines can also set high penalties for modifications on the flight booking or for cancellations. If travellers do not make use of their flight (No Show), the flight will not be refunded.
		</p>
		<p>

In this case the client will be notified during the booking process.
		</p>

		<h4>We strongly recommend to buy a travel insurance, which protects the traveller(s) in case of a cancellation.</h4>
		<p>
			<b>Name change of traveller (costs per person)</b>
		</p>
		<ul  class="col-md-12 pl-4" style="list-style: circle;">
			<li>Up to 15 days before arrival: no costs*</li>
			<li>From 14 days before arrival: EUR 50*</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			*In case providers (such as hotels, airlines etc) charge more, additional fees may apply. In some cases providers do not allow name changes and a new booking has to be made. Clients will be informed during booking process.
		</p>

		<h2>Number of participants</h2>
		<p>
			TOURCOM GmbH reserves the right to cancel a tour if the minimum number of travellers required for a specific travel program hasn’t been reached 30 days prior to departure. TOURCOM GmbH will notify the client immediately of the reason for the cancellation. The client will be offered another travel program or a full refund of the amount already paid.
		</p>

		<h2>Changes in reservations</h2>
		<p>
			Any changes in reservations that have been previously confirmed (arrival or departure date, travel conditions, etc.) that occur longer than 30 days before the planned execution of services are subject to a EUR 50 fine, ore more if TOURCOM GmbH proves having incurred higher expenses. Claims for a change of booking by client made within 30 days before the planned execution of services can be honoured - if at all - only by way of withdrawal and simultaneous new booking. This shall not apply to claims of changes involving minor costs only. If a traveller wishes to alter the trip significantly during the journey, any changes will need to be confirmed and a EUR 70 fine applies, or more if TOURCOM GmbH proves having incurred higher expenses. The traveller will also be responsible for any possible costs charged by service providers as a result of any cancellations or changes. Airlines set their own strict penalties related to amendments, replacements, etc. before and after issuing plane tickets /e-tickets. This type of occasional expenses together with the amendment fee would be added to clients invoice.
		</p>

		<h2>Termination Right of TOURCOM GmbH</h2>
		<p>
			TOURCOM GmbH may terminate the present contract without notice in the event that  travellers seriously disturb the travelling despite a warning by TOURCOM GmbH, or misbehave in such manner which justifies an immediate withdrawal from the contract. In the event of a termination by TOURCOM GmbH, the latter is still entitled to receive the payment of the price, to be set off against saved expenses and such benefits as obtained from a different use of unclaimed services - including any amounts credited by the service providers.
		</p>

		<h2>Force Majeure/Act of God</h2>
		<p>
			If the service, which is contractually agreed, cannot be delivered because of an Act of God, such as a war, strike, catastrophes, etc. or because of imminent danger, such as the rising or falling of water/sea levels etc.,  both TOURCOM GmbH and client have the right to withdraw from the contract.
