<p>
Whenever you access our webpage your browser automatically submits your current IP address as well as which browser you are using. This data together with the time of your request, the status and the page requested is stored in our logs for a few days in order to identify and rectify error conditions or security issues (Art. 6 Nr. 1 lit. f GDPR). We are unable to identify you via your IP address without serving a court order to your provider. Additionally under most circumstances your IP address changes every 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
We keep this data to us and will not transmit it to anyone else unless forced to by legal requirements or court orders. An exception to this are processors such as the company hosting our webpage. In accordance to Art. 28 GDPR these processors are bound by contracts to only use the data for our purposes, they are not allowed to use it for their own purposes. Besides this strict contract we also verified whether their IT security is up to the state of the art. 
</p>
<p>
In case you use one of our contact forms or decide to send us an email, we will receive your personal data such as your email address and your name. We will use this data to answer your enquiry (Art. 6 Nr. 1 lit. b GDPR). If we are required by e.g. taxation laws to keep a record of this transaction we will store the data as long as we are legally required to (Art. 6 Nr. 1 lit. c GDPR). If there is no legal requirement we will delete the data as soon as we know your enquiry was answered successfully. 
</p>
<p>
We will not transfer this data to a third party except we are forced to by legal requirements, court orders etc. We might also use processors as mentioned above.

<h3>Information on Google Analytics</h3>
<p>
If you have given your consent, Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google LLC (“Google”) is used on this website. The use includes the “Universal Analytics” operating mode.

Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users interact with the site.

Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended to include IP anonymisation in order to ensure anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). The IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.
